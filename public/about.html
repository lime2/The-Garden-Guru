    <p>Garden Guru makes it esay to find credible information about all plants. With this information design a betutify low maintaince garden can become easy and stress free. My mother enjoys her spare time by spending it in a garden, however she struggles to find the right plants to plant. Her beliefs are firmly rooted that the plants should be drought resistant. If she had the Garden Guru, her many hours spend under duress,could have been free of stress.</p>
